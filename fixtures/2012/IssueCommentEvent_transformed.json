Maybe I can add support to versioned\\nresource in dev mode. But I don't think this is really needed from\\ngreenscript's perspective. The power of GreenScript is not only compressing\\nand minimizing, but also dependency management. And this feature is built\\non the basis that your resource files are loaded directly with pages, not\\nvia ajax call. Meaning you use greenscript in case you have all html/js/css\\ncode loaded along with page refresh. In that case I don't think we need\\nversioned resource at all. Because you can press ctrl-f5 to force browser\\nto reload all resource files. And ctrl-f5 only fails when you load resource\\nfiles in ajax call, in which case the dependency management is done via\\njavascript libraries like LAB.js, instead of greenscript.\\n\\n\\nOn Wed, Feb 15, 2012 at 10:37 AM, tazmaniax <\\nreply@reply.github.com\\n> wrote:\\n\\n> The following discussion suggests a mechanism to avoid browser cached\\n> resources when deploying a new application version:\\n> https://groups.google.com/d/msg/play-framework/1saij-OP1go/CcuN2VxxD4YJ\\n>\\n> This mechanism involves inserting a version number contained in a local\\n> file into the external prefix for static 'public' resources, e.g.:\\n> GET\\n> /public/%{out.write(play.getVirtualFile(\\\".version\\\").contentAsString())}%/\\n>  staticDir:public\\n>\\n> Greenscript does not take this sort of mapping into account when returning\\n> URLs for managed resources.\\n>\\n> ---\\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\\n> https://github.com/greenlaw110/greenscript/issues/36\\n>\",\"url\":\"https://api.github.com/repos/greenlaw110/greenscript/issues/comments/3972356\"},\"action\":\"created\"}",
