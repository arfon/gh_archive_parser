      "body": "Hi, \r\n\r\nFirst of all, thank you for sharing your review work. \r\n\r\nIt seems that `lab-workbook` is required to make snapshot in `train-cifar.lua`; thus I installed it with your repository (https://github.com/gcr/lab-workbook). \r\n\r\nHowever, this package asked me to have a configuration file `~/.lab-workbook-config`, and I have no idea how to set it. \r\n\r\nIs there anyone who help me to use it? \r\n\r\nI would also appreciate if someone let me know I can snapshot weights with other methods. I used to use caffe and I'm new to lua and torch. \r\n\r\nThanks, "

Here's some documentation for the `lab-workbook` library:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/gcr/lab-workbook#readme\r\n\r\nHope this helps!\r\n\r\nIf you don't like this library, I hope it's pretty easy to replace all the calls with logging/saving of your choice. It should be pretty self-evident what each call is doing..."
